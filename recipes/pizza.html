        <li>2 1/2 cups bread flour</li>

      <h2>Steps:</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand
          until creamy, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt, and the yeast
          mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a stiff dough has
          formed. Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
          Meanwhile, preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and pat out into a round.
          Transfer to a pizza pan that has been lightly greased with olive oil.
          Pat and stretch dough into a thin crust. Sprinkle cornmeal over crust
          and spread with tomato sauce. Top with mozzarella cheese, Parmesan
          cheese, basil leaves, pepperoni, olives, bell pepper, and mushrooms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
          Serve hot.
        </li>
      </ol>
